Most of this time was spent getting to grips with JavaScript (Node and Express on the backend, followed by a front-end introduction to React).

It was challenging and stressful at times but enjoyable with it.

We apply this theory by looking into how to \u201cnormalise\u201d data and how to ingest, clean and prepare data to be stored in a data warehouse. This is part of the so-called ETL pattern, extract \u2014 transform \u2014 load (capture and prepare the data; make them available for analysis).
